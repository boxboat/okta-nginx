# okta-nginx

This repository builds a Docker Image that protects an upstream server using [Okta's OpenID Connect](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc) `Authorization Code` flow

## Prerequisites

- [Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/) account
- An Open ID Connect application supporting the `Authorization Code` flow

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `PROXY_PASS` - The upstream to proxy authenticated requests to.  Should include scheme, host, and port e.g. `http://localhost:8080`
- `CLIENT_ID` - The Client ID can be found on the 'General' tab of the Web application that you created earlier in the Okta Developer Console
- `CLIENT_SECRET` - The Client Secret be found on the 'General' tab of the Web application that you created earlier in the Okta Developer Console
- `ISSUER` - Issuer is the URL of the authorization server that will perform authentication. All Developer Accounts have a 'default' authorization server. The issuer is a combination of your Org URL (found in the upper right of the console home page) and /oauth2/default. For example, `https://xxxxx.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default`
- `AUDIENCE` - The Audience can be found on the 'Settings' tab of the Authorization Server.  The 'default' authorization server uses the audience `api://default`
- `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` - The Login Redirect URL can be found on the 'General' tab of the Web application that you created earlier in the Okta Developer Console

### Optional

- `COOKIE_NAME` - Defaults to `okta-jwt`. The name of the cookie that holds the Authorization Token
- `INJECT_REFRESH_JS` - Defaults to `true`.  Set to `false` to disable injection of JavaScript that transparently refreshes Access Tokens when they are close to expiring
- `LISTEN` - Defaults to `80`.  Specify another port to change the listening port number.  See [nginx listen](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#listen) for options, such as TLS and unix sockets
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` - Defaults to `5`.  Timeout for calling the Okta `token` endpoint to retrieve an Authorization Token
- `SSO_PATH` - Defaults to `/sso/`. Path for SSO error and refresh endpoints.  Should include leading and trailing slash

## Authenticated Headers Passed to Upstream Server

- `X-Forwarded-User` - Contains the forwarded user's username.  Comes from the `sub` assertion in the Auth Token.

## Install From Source

1.  Build container `./docker-build.sh`
2.  Set environment variables in vars.env to match your deployment
3.  Run container `./docker-run.sh`
